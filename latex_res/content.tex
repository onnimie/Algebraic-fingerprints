\section{Introduction}

In recent years, there have been rapid advances in the algorithms for combinatorial problems. 
This has been greatly sparked by the development in algebraic techniques for solving the 
multilinear monomial detection problem, i.e., finding whether a multivariate polynomial contains a multilinear monomial, 
first introduced by \citeauthor{Koutis05} in \cite{Koutis05}, where the set packing problem is
reduced to multilinear monomial detection.

Namely, the technique of algebraic fingeprinting, first introduced in
\cite{Koutis08} and further developed in \cite{Williams09}, 
has found great success for many combinatorial problems. 
For example, with algebraic fingerprinting, the $k$-path problem 
that previously could be solved in \bigOstar{4^{k}} time by \citeauthor{Chen07} in \cite{Chen07}, 
could be solved in \bigOstar{2^{3k/2}} time in \cite{Koutis08}. 
\amnote{What is the meaning of \bigOstar{}?}
This result was quickly improved in \cite{Williams09}, where an \bigOstar{2^k} algorithm was given.

\amnote*[inline,nomargin]{This technique was further developed by
\citeauthor{Björklund14} \cite{Björklund14}, who showed ...}{
Of course, this technique was further developed, and soon after in
\cite{Björklund14} Björklund et al. showed an algorithm

\amnote{Note use of \texttt{\textbackslash citeauthor}}
that solved the Hamiltonian problem (Hamiltonicity), i.e., finding whether a given graph contains a simple path that visits 
every vertex, in \bigOstar{1.657^n} time. Soon enough, for $k$-path, an \bigOstar{1.66^k} algorithm was found \cite{Björklund17}. 
\amnote{Did Björklund really develop the technique further? or did he only show
how to apply it to another problem?}
The fastest algorithms for Hamiltonicity before this ran in
\amnote*{$n$ or $k$?}{ \bigOstar{2^n} }
and were known since 1962 \cite{HelKar62}, \cite{Bellman62}.
This was a significant improvement on a problem that had seen no progress in nearly fifty years.

\subsection{Research goals and thesis structure}
\amnote[inline,nomargin]{This section can be shortened to one paragraph}

The goals of this thesis are to find out how multilinear monomial detection is relevant in 
combinatorial problems, and how algebraic fingerprints can be utilized to design faster 
algorithms for problems that use multilinear monomial detection. Also, interesting ideas 
regarding algebraic fingerprints are explored for.

Multilinear monomial detection 
is a fundamental problem, since many important combinatorial problems can be reduced into it 
via a problem specific algebraization. Thus, faster algorithms and new ideas for multilinear monomial detection 
are important.

Multilinear monomial detection is essentially searching for solutions among non-solutions, 
both of which are encoded as monomials in a polynomial. 
The technique of algebraic fingerprinting is present in multilinear monomial detection. 
With algebraic fingerprints, unwanted cancelation of solution monomials due to the characteristic of a field can be prevented. 
Moreover, algebraic fingerprints can be used to cancel non-solution monomials by abusing the characteristic.

\amnote*{No need for this since you already have ToC}{%
In the next subsections, the thesis discusses algebraization and reduction into multilinear monomial detection. 
The section 2 covers preliminaries. In section 3, the thesis discusses general multilinear monomial detection. 
In section 4, some problem specific instances of multilinear monomial detection are given, and clever 
utilizations of algebraic fingerprints are shown. Section 5 concludes the
thesis.

\subsection{Algebrization of combinatorial problems}

A combinatorial problem asks whether a given finite set of objects satisfies some given constraints. 
For example, the $k$-path problem asks for, given a finite set of vertices and edges, 
a simple path of $k$ vertices. The solutions and non-solutions (solution space) to combinatorial problems can be thought of as 
combinations of the given objects.
\amnote*{Probably one can drop the vertices and think only about edges?}{%
The solution space for the $k$-path problem
consists of combinations of $k$ vertices and $k-1$ edges. 
}
A non-solution combination would contain duplicate vertices, or edges that
contain vertices outside the combination.

\amnote[inline,nomargin]{This sounds like a very simple problem... But I guess
the catch is that we want an algorithm with complexity depending only on $k$?}

Algebraization is reducing a given problem into an algebraic form,
\amnote*[inline,nomargin]{that is}{i.e.}, a
question regarding some algebraic property of some algebraic entity. 
In an algebraization of a combinatorial problem, the algebraic entity can be constructed from algebraic elements defined from the 
set of objects given as an input. The motivation behind the construction is some algebraic property that, 
when satisfied, gives a solution to the problem.

\amnote{Somewhere we need to reference the reader to Sect.~2 for non-familiar
terms like multivariate, algebras, etc.}
In \cite{Valiant92}, it was observed that multivariate polynomials in certain algebras have natural combinatorial interpretations. 
Utilizing this idea, \cite{Koutis05} managed to reduce a combinatorial problem
into an algebraic form, that is, multilinear monomial detection. 
First, we introduce multiple variables that 
correspond to elements from the set of objects given as input. 
Then, we construct an arithmetic circuit representing a multivariate polynomial, such that it 
encodes all solutions and non-solutions as multivariate monomials, 
with multilinear monomials corresponding to solutions. 
Thus, the task of finding a satisfying combination to the combinatorial problem has been reduced to 
finding a multilinear monomial from the multivariate polynomial.
It follows that a decision problem is answered by 
the existence of a multilinear monomial, and a counting problem by the number of multilinear monomials.

Appropriate definitions for the variables are problem-specific. In the following section, this thesis gives a 
reduction into multilinear monomial detection, shown in \cite{KouWil15}, 
for the $k$-3D matching problem. Another simple example can be found, for the set packing problem, in \cite{Koutis05}.

\amnote[inline,nomargin]{I would merge the two sections and use the $k$-3D
matching as an example to the explanation above}

\subsection{Reducing $k$-3D matching into multilinear monomial detection}

The $k$-3D matching problem is defined as follows:

\begin{problem}
  \problemtitle{$k$-\textsc{3D matching}}
  \probleminput{Three disjoint sets $A$, $B$ and $C$, and a set of triples $T\subset A\times B\times C$.}
  \problemquestion{Is there a subset $M\subseteq T$, such that $\abs{M} = k$ and 
  $\forall m \in M$: None of the elements in $m$ appear in
  \amnote*[inline,nomargin]{$M \setminus \{m\}$}{$M\backslash \{m\}$}}
\end{problem}
\amnote{Use \texttt{\textbackslash setminus} instead of \texttt{\textbackslash
backslash}}
\amnote{$T = A \times B \times C$ not allowed?}
\amnote{Either convert $\forall$ into text or what follows into maths}

We begin by defining new variables corresponding to the elements in $A$, $B$ and $C$, 
labeled as $a_i$, $b_j$ and $c_k$, respectively, where $i\in [\abs{A}]$, $j\in
[\abs{B}]$ and $k\in [\abs{C}]$. 
\amnote{Def. of $\abs{\cdot}$?}

For every triple $t \in T$, we define a multilinear monomial $x$ that is a
product of the elements in $t$. 
\amnote{Over what object are we doing multiplication?}
We introduce a set $X$ that satisfies the following:
%\begin{center}$\forall x \in X$: $x = abc$ : $(a, b, c) \in T$.\end{center}
\[
\forall x \in X: x = abc : (a, b, c) \in T.
\]
\amnote{Use \textbackslash[ ... \textbackslash] for display math}
\amnote[inline,nomargin]{Probably meant $\forall x \in X, x = abc ...$?}

Next, we define multivariate polynomials $P_1$ and $P_k$ as follows:
\begin{center}$P_1 = \displaystyle \sum_{X}$ ,   $P_k = P_1^k$.\end{center}
\amnote{Meaning of $\sum_X$?}

Following this construction, we observe that $P_k$, when expanded into a sum of multivariate monomials, 
contains a multilinear term if and only if the original $k$-3D matching instance can be answered in the positive. 
Furthermore, every multilinear monomial in the expanded $P_k$ corresponds to a solution to the problem, and 
the solutions can be directly found from the variables in the multilinear monomial. Thus, 
a successful reduction into multilinear monomial detection has been given for the $k$-3D mapping.

An example instance of $k$-3D matching with this exact algebraization can be found in \cite{KouWil15}.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sect:prelims}

It is necessary to recall basic algebraic concepts 
before further discussing multilinear monomial detection and algebraic fingerprinting. 
\cref{sect:prelims_algebra} gives definitions for a group, ring and field, 
and some useful concepts regarding them. 
\cref{sect:prelims_other} goes through other notation and terminology used 
throughout the thesis.

\subsection{Groups, rings and fields} %polynomial rings, group algebra, char of field
\label{sect:prelims_algebra}

A group \amnote*{There is also \texttt{\textbackslash mathbf}}{$\textbf G$}
is a tuple $(G, +)$, where $G$ is a set of elements,
\amnote{See TeX source}
%$+$ : $G \times G \longrightarrow G$
$+ \colon G \times G \to G$
is a binary operation closed under 
the elements in $G$, $+$ is associative, every element $g\in G$ has an inverse $g^{-1}\in G$, and $G$ contains 
an identity element $e$ such that $g + e = g$, $g + g^{-1} = e$ and $e = e^{-1}$. Moreover, $\textbf G$ is called $Abelian$ if 
$+$ is also commutative.
\amnote{I think $e = e^{-1}$ follows from the other requirements (but that is
not so important)}

A ring $\textbf R$ is a tuple
\amnote*[inline,nomargin]{$(R,+,\cdot)$}{$(R, \cdot )$},
where $R = (G, +)$ is an Abelian group, $\cdot$ : $G \times G \longrightarrow G$ 
is a binary operation closed under $G$. We call the binary operations $+$ and
$\cdot$
%as
addition and multiplication, respectively. 
Note, that from here on we use $R$ as the set of elements defined for $\textbf R$. 
In general, a bold typeface \textbf X represents a group, ring or field and $X$ its set of elements. 
$R$ must contain a multiplicative identity $\textbf 1 \in R$ such that $\forall a \in R$: $a \cdot \textbf 1 = a$. 
We notate the additive identity $e$ required for the group as $\textbf 0$ from here on. 
Observe, that for any $R \neq \{\textbf 0\}$, $\textbf 1 \neq \textbf 0$.  
Left and right distributive laws hold for rings, i.e., 
\begin{center}
  $\forall a, b, c \in R$: $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \land (b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)$.
\end{center}
$u \in R$ is called $unit$ if it holds that $\exists v \in R$: $u \cdot v = v \cdot u = \textbf 1$, 
i.e., it has a multiplicative inverse $v \in R$.

A field $\textbf F = (F, +, \cdot)$ is defined with the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(F, +)$ is an Abelian group
  \item $(F\backslash \{\textbf 0\}, \cdot )$ is an Abelian group
  \item Left and right distributive laws hold for \textbf F
\end{itemize}

Equivalently, a ring is a field if every non-zero element is unit, $\textbf 1 \neq \textbf 0$, and multiplication is commutative. 
The $characteristic$ of a field \textbf F is defined as follows:
%\begin{center}
  \begin{equation}
    char(\textbf F) =
      \begin{cases}
        min\{n \in \N : n \cdot \textbf 1 = \textbf 0 \}\\
        0 & \text{if such $n$ does not exist}\\
      \end{cases}       
  \end{equation}
%\end{center}

Note, that a field \textbf F with 
characteristic 2 satisfies the following:
\begin{center}
  $\forall u \in F$: $u + u = u \cdot (\textbf 1 + \textbf 1) = u \cdot \textbf 0 = \textbf 0$
\end{center}

\section{General framework for detecting multilinear monomials}

The detection of multilinear monomials in a multivariate polynomial is a fundamental problem, 
since many important problems can be reduced to it [TODO: quick examples (just refs?)]. 
Therefore, any progress in general multilinear monomial detection directly implies 
faster algorithms
\amnote*{These problems should \enquote{live} in their own subsection, then you
can just call them \enquote{problems from Sect.~X.Y}}{%
for all problems, that are reduced to and solved with general
multilinear monomial detection. 
} TODO: relate to section 2: related works

In this section, we define the parameterized multilinear monomial detection problem, 
and give some non-algebraic background on solving it. Then, we discuss the 
algebraic framework by \citeauthor{KouWil15} \cite{Williams09, KouWil15} 
and its limits. Finally, we briefly touch on finding a solution when 
its existence is detected.

\subsection{Problem definition}

The general, parameterized multilinear monomial detection problem is defined as follows: 

\amnote{Arithmetic circuit has bounded or unbounded fan-in / fan-out?}
\begin{problem}
  \problemtitle{$k$-\textsc{multilinear monomial detection}}
  \probleminput{A commutative arithmetic circuit $A$ over a set of variables $X$ representing a polynomial $P(X)$.}
  \problemquestion{Does the polynomial $P(X)$ extended as a sum of monomials 
  contain a multilinear monomial of degree $k$?}
\end{problem}

Clearly, an upper bound for solving the problem is given by a 
naive expansion of $A$ into $P(X)$ and evaluation of $P(X)$.
However, this is not optimal: an $N$-degree polynomial will have $2^{\Theta(N)}$ 
possible monomials, and most problems that can use this algebraization, 
have been solved with faster algorithms. %(TODO: quick example?) 
This motivates the detection of multilinear monomials 
without fully expanding $A$ into a sum of monomials.

Since only multilinear terms are important in $P(X)$, 
any squared variable can be instantly discarded as soons as it is formed in $A$. 
This can be achieved with dynamic programming to create a polynomial $P'(X)$ that 
only contains multilinear monomials. Since there are $2^N$ multilinear monomials in $P'(X)$ with 
$N$ variables, this method results in a
\amnote*{but still exponential}{faster} algorithm than with naive expansion.

%TODO: Maybe rewrite the algebra here 
%(first quickly in English, then in maths, and maybe label the mapping functions)
However, the underlying problems are usually FPT. This implies that scaling exponentially 
with the number of variables is far from optimal. In order for the complexity of the algorithm to scale 
with the parameter $k$, we can reduce the number of variables by mapping $X$ into $Y$, where 
$\abs{X} \geq \abs{Y}$ and
\amnote*{Def?}{$\abs{Y} \propto k$}, and dynamically evaluate $P(Y)$ instead of
$P(X)$. 
\amnote{$P$ is unchanged, so it still expects $\abs{X}$ arguments...?}

However, since $\abs{X} \geq \abs{Y}$, a multilinear monomial in $P(X)$ may not be multilinear in $P(Y)$. 
For an algorithm to detect a multilinear monomial, it is necessary to use different mappings 
from $X$ into $Y$ until a multilinear monomial survives the mapping. However, the probability 
that any given multilinear monomial survives this mapping is around $e^{-\abs{Y}}$ \cite{KouWil15}.
This implies that \bigO{e^{\abs{Y}}} random mappings must be tried for a
multilinear monomial to survive with a reasonable constant probability. Thus, a
$k$-multilinear monomial is detected with a 
\amnote*{randomized}{non-deterministic} algorithm in \bigOstar{(2e)^{\abs{Y}}} time, where $\abs{Y} \propto k$.

This is essentially the idea behind color coding introduced by \citeauthor{Alon95} \cite{Alon95}. 
Although here given in this algebraic form for the $k$-multilinear monomial detection, 
color coding is combinatorial, and does not rely on algebraic techniques. 
However, since $k$-multilinear monomial detection is a purely algebraic problem, it is reasonable to 
conjecture that there is an algebraic method for solving it.

\omnote{I think this should maybe be in the introduction section rather than here?}
\amnote{I agree}
Indeed, a faster algebraic method exists; the technique of algebraic fingerprinting 
first introduced by \citeauthor{Koutis08} \cite{Koutis08} and 
further developed by \citeauthor{Williams09} \cite{Williams09} 
solves $k$-multilinear monomial detection in \bigOstar{2^k} time. 
Since the technique focuses on the abstract $k$-multilinear monomial detection, to which 
most parameterized problems can be reduced to, it gives a general framework for 
solving parameterized problems \cite{KouWil15}.

\subsection{Algebraic multilinear monomial detection}
%TODO: go through idea of algebraic assignment and specifications for a suitable algebra, 
%then lead to fingerprinting (fingerprints solve an issue of unwanted cancellation due to characteristic)

The idea of discarding squared variables as soon as they are formed in $A$ 
can be expressed algebraically: any squared variable should be identical to
zero. 
\amnote{Quotient ring}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:squared_to_zero}
\forall x \in X: x^2 = \mathbf{0}
\end{equation}
This implies that any non-multilinear monomial will evaluate to zero in $P(X)$. 
Therefore, $P(X)$ will identically evaluate to zero if there are no multilinear monomials, 
i.e., there exist no solutions to the original problem.

Assigning values
\amnote*{The other way around?}{from an algebra $\mathbf{G}$ into $X$}
to meet (\ref{eq:squared_to_zero}) 
while still maintaining multilinear monomials seems to be a powerful idea.
Particularly matrices prove to be especially useful. Note, for example, that 
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
  0 & 0 \\ 
  1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
  0 & 0 \\ 
  0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
\amnote{What is the underlying field?}

For faster evaluation of $P(X)$, however, $\mathbf{G}$ needs other requirements as well. 
The binary operations of $\mathbf{G}$ must be fast. With matrices, this means that their 
dimension must be as small as possible. Moreover, in order to beat color coding, 
the multilinear monomials must 
survive the assignment from $G$ into $X$ with a reasonable constant probability. Recall that 
with color coding, the probability is exponentially small to the parameter $k$.

Such $\mathbf{G}$ is given in \cite{Koutis08}, where \citeauthor{Koutis08} uses the group $\Z_2^k$ 
and a known \cite{Terras99} 
isomorphic mapping $\rho \colon \Z_2^k \to M^{2^k \times 2^k}$, where $M^{d \times d}$ is a 
\amnote*{Any group? Specific one?}{$d$-dimensional matrix group with matrix multiplication.}
 Note that for (\ref{eq:squared_to_zero}), 
\[
\forall a \in \Z_2^k \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}, i \in [2^k]: \rho(a)_{i,i} = 0\]and \[
\rho(\mathbf{0}) = \mathbf{0}.
\]

$\Z_2^k$, however, has a characteristic of 2. (TODO: this implies cancelation... )

\amnote{Why is char $0$ not an option here?}

(will have problem with characteristic 2) 
--> lead into auxiliary fingerprints (in this case, solved with group algebra $\Z_2[\Z_2^k]$, i.e., 
multiplying monomials with $\{\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{0}\}$)

%In \cite{Koutis08}, an \bigOstar{2^k} 
%non-deterministic algorithm for $k$-multilinear monomial detection was given.


\subsubsection{Fingerprinting to prevent unwanted cancelation}

To prevent multilinear terms from canceling \amnote[inline,nomargin]{out} due to
characteristic, we use a set of auxiliary indeterminates $F$. 
These indeterminates, called fingerprints, are introduced in the algebrization 
of the combinatorial problem, such that every monomial in $A$ is unique. 
This results in the uniqueness of multilinear monomials, which prevents
cancelation.
\amnote{Probably more detail is needed}

However, introducing new indeterminates raises the degree of the multilinear monomials. 
Therefore it may be, that there are not enough matrices to assign such that there would be no 
duplicates in a multilinear monomial. As a result, higher
\amnote*[inline,nomargin]{dimensional}{dimension} matrices are needed, which 
results in exponentially slower matrix multiplication. %which has a time complexity of \bigO{n^2.31788} \cite{DuanZhouWu22}. 
Thus, introducing new indeterminates slows the algorithm significantly. 

In \cite{Koutis08} instead of assigning $F$ and $X$ values from the same algebra, 
\citeauthor{Koutis08} uses random assignment from $\{\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1}\}$ into $F$. 
This is achieved by using the group algebra $\Z_2[\Z_2^k]$, where the field $\Z_2$ can be 
thought of as the fingerprints. 
With this assignment, there is a constant probability that a multilinear monomial will have an odd coefficient, 
thus surviving the cancelation due to characteristic.

\subsubsection{The algebraic framework for parameterized problems}

\cite{Williams09} reduces multilinear detection (after assinging variables values from some algebra) 
to
\amnote*{Text seems to presume reader knows what it is}{polynomial identity testing}
for a polynomial
\amnote*{\$ ... \$}{P(A)} that has fingerprints as variables. 
Fingerprints are then assigned values from a field that has more elements than P(A) has roots, which 
means that P(A) evaluates to non-zero with high probability (if there are solutions)

The algebraic fingerprinting framework by Koutis and Williams  
solves $k$-multilinear monomial detection by essentially reducing it to 
polynomial identity testing. The polynomial identity testing problem is defined 
as follows:

\begin{problem}
  \problemtitle{\textsc{Polynomial identity testing}}
  \probleminput{An arithmetic circuit $A$ that computes the polynomial $P(X)$ in field $\mathbf{X}$.}
  \problemquestion{Is $P(X)$ identical to the zero polynomial, i.e., $P(X) = \mathbf{0}$?}
\end{problem}
\amnote{Field $\mathbf{X}$ fixed in advance?}

\amnote[inline,nomargin]{Motivate why PIT is not a trivial problem.
(It might well seem like it is!)}

TODO

\subsubsection{Limits of the framework}
\label{sect:limits}

TODO: give some cons wrt. color coding (difficult derandomization, 
are we able to add weights for optimization problems?) %(cost-constrained mld?)

TODO: explain the limit in general multilinear detection with this algebraic framework 
(impossible to find better algebra than what is used for the current fastest k-mld algorithm), \cite{KouWil09}

\subsection{Finding the solution}

Multilinear monomial detection has only been given as a detector for a solution,
i.e., a decision algorithm. 
\amnote*{Yes, but probably restrict it to $\sim1$ page (there is enough content
as it is)}{ Talk about actually finding the solution.  }

\cite{Koutis08} gives an algorithm that solves the decision problem for $k$-path. 
$k$-path is found with \bigOstar{n+min(k^2, m)} applications of the algorithm.

\cite{Williams09} solves the decision problem for $k$-path. \cite{Williams09} also gives an algorithm 
that finds a path when it is known that a $k$-path exists.

\cite{Björklund17} solves the decision problem for $k$-path starting at some vertex $s$. 
A $k$-path can be found by just applying the algorithm for every vertex.

\section{Improving algebraic fingerprinting}

As mentioned in \cref{sect:limits}, the algebraic fingerprinting framework proposed by 
\citeauthor{Koutis08} and \citeauthor{Williams09} \cite{Williams09, KouWil15} for 
$k$-multilinear monomial detection has
\amnote*{$O$ and \enquote{lower bound} don't go well together}{a lower bound of \bigOstar{2^k}. }
However, this framework \amnote[inline,nomargin]{is very generic since it}
approaches the abstract multilinear monomial detection without 
utilizing the combinatorial properties specific to the underlying problem. 
The idea of adding auxiliary fingerprint variables in the algebrization, though, 
has potential for these properties. TODO: rephrase more clearly

Indeed,
\amnote*{for...?}{faster algorithms}
 have been found by designing new algebrizations with techniques 
similar to algebraic fingerprinting, where the fingerprints are designed to 
\amnote*{make use of}{abuse}
the underlying combinatorial properties. In \cref{sect:cancel_nonsolutions}, 
we show how \citeauthor{Björklund14} \cite{Björklund14}
exploited the cancelation due to characteristic to cancel non-solution monomials 
by clever design of fingerprints. 

Furthermore, the evaluation of the polynomial in the algebraic fingerprinting framework is done sequentially. 
However, the matrix representations of the group algebras used in \cite{Williams09} 
offer possibilities for parallelization.
In \cref{sect:parallelization}, \amnote[inline,nomargin]{we discuss} the ideas of 
\citeauthor{Midas19} behind the distributed multilinear monomial detection
\cite{Midas19} \amnote*[inline,nomargin]{}{(are discussed)}.

\subsection{Fingerprinting for cancelation of non-solutions}
\label{sect:cancel_nonsolutions}

TODO: go over Björklund et al. for k-path or Hamiltonicity, managed to design fingerprints such that non-solutions cancel

In the algebraic framework by \citeauthor{Koutis08} and \citeauthor{Williams09}, 
fingerprints prevent the cancelation of multilinear monomials. 
Attacking the Hamiltonian path problem, however, \citeauthor{Björklund14} 
designed fingerprints such that non-multilinear monomials, i.e. non-solution terms, 
cancel due to characteristic, while the multilinear terms 
remain with constant probability \cite{Björklund14}. This resulted in the current 
fastest algorithm for undirected Hamiltonicity, running in \bigOstar{2^n} time.

Before discussing the algebrization and the fingerprints, 
we define the Hamiltonian path problem.

\begin{problem}
  \problemtitle{\textsc{Hamiltonian path (Hamiltonicity)}}
  \probleminput{A directed graph $G = (V,E)$.}
  \problemquestion{Does $G$ contain a simple path that visits every vertex?}
\end{problem}

TODO: give the algebrization and/or show how it works

\subsection{Parallelizing multilinear monomial detection}
\label{sect:parallelization}

\amnote[inline,nomargin]{Probably very ambitious to describe the full thing
here... (You already need to focus on getting the details right in Sects. 4 and
5.1.) Maybe instead just give a broad picture of what other things people have
considered? (unless this is really the only other thing out there)}
