abstract="We study the problem of deciding whether an n-variate polynomial, presented as an arithmetic circuit G, contains a degree k square-free term with an odd coefficient. We show that if G can be evaluated over the integers modulo 2k{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}1 in time t and space s, the problem can be decided with constant probability in O((kn{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}t)2k) time and O(kn{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}s) space. Based on this, we present new and faster algorithms for two well studied problems: (i) an O*(2mk) algorithm for the m-set k-packing problem and (ii) an O*(23k/2) algorithm for the simple k-path problem, or an O*(2k) algorithm if the graph has an induced k-subgraph with an odd number of Hamiltonian paths. Our algorithms use poly(n) random bits, comparing to the 2O(k) random bits required in prior algorithms, while having similar low space requirements.",

    abstract = { We present a Monte Carlo algorithm for Hamiltonicity detection in an \$n\$-vertex undirected graph running in \$O(1.657^{n})\$ time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first superpolynomial improvement on the worst case runtime for the problem since the \$O^*(2^n)\$ bound established for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) over 50 years ago [R. Bellman, J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 9 (1962), pp. 61--63], [M. Held and R. M. Karp, J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math., 10 (1962), pp. 196--210]. (\$O^*(f(n))\$ suppresses polylogarithmic functions in \$f(n)\$). It answers in part the first open problem in Woeginger's 2003 survey on exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. For bipartite graphs, we improve the bound to \$O^*(\sqrt{2}^n)\subset O(1.415^{n})\$ time. Both the bipartite and the general algorithm can be implemented to use space polynomial in \$n\$. We combine several recently resurrected ideas to get the results. Our main technical contribution is a new algebraic characterization of Hamiltonian graphs. We introduce an extension of Hamiltonicity called Labeled Hamiltonicity and relate it to a Labeled Cycle Cover Sum in which we are set to count weighted arc labeled cycle covers over a finite field of characteristic two. The Labeled Cycle Cover Sum can be evaluated efficiently via determinants. }

abstract = {Improved randomized and deterministic algorithms are presented for PATH, MATCHING, and PACKING problems. Our randomized algorithms are based on the divide-and-conquer technique, and improve previous best algorithms for these problems. For example, for the k-PATH problem, our randomized algorithm runs in time O(4kk3.42m) and space O(nklogk + m), improving the previous best randomized algorithm for the problem that runs in time O(5.44kkm) and space O(2kkn + m). To achieve improved deterministic algorithms, we study a number of previously proposed de-randomization schemes, and also develop a new derandomization scheme. These studies result in a number of deterministic algorithms: one of time O(4k+o(k)m) for the k-PATH problem, one of time O(2.803kk nlog2 n) for the 3-D MATCHING problem, and one of time O(43k+o(k)n) for the 3-SET PACKING problem. All these significantly improve previous best algorithms for the problems.},

abstract = {A subfamily F′ of a set family F is said to q-represent F if for every A ∈ F and B of size q such that A∩B = ∅ there exists a set A′ ∈ F′ such that A′ ∩ B = ∅. Recently, we provided an algorithm that, for a given family F of sets of size p together with an integer q, efficiently computes a q-representative family F′ of F of size approximately (p+q p). In this article, we consider the efficient computation of q-representative families for product families F. A family F is a product family if there exist families A and B such that F = { A, ∪, B : A ∈ A, B ∈ B, A, ∩, B = ∅}. Our main technical contribution is an algorithm that, given A, B and q, computes a q-representative family F′ of F. The running time of our algorithm is sublinear in |F| for many choices of A, B, and q that occur naturally in several dynamic programming algorithms. We also give an algorithm for the computation of q-representative families for product families F in the more general setting where q-representation also involves independence in a matroid in addition to disjointness. This algorithm considerably outperforms the naive approach where one first computes F from A and B and then computes the q-representative family F′ from F.We give two applications of our new algorithms for computing q-representative families for product families. The first is a 3.8408knO(1) deterministic algorithm for the Multilinear Monomial Detection (k-MlD) problem. The second is a significant improvement of deterministic dynamic programming algorithms for “connectivity problems” on graphs of bounded treewidth.},

abstract="The algebraic framework introduced in [Koutis, Proc. of the 35thICALP 2008] reduces several combinatorial problems in parameterized complexity to the problem of detecting multilinear degree-k monomials in polynomials presented as circuits. The best known (randomized) algorithm for this problem requires only O*(2k) time and oracle access to an arithmetic circuit, i.e. the ability to evaluate the circuit on elements from a suitable group algebra. This algorithm has been used to obtain the best known algorithms for several parameterized problems. In this paper we use communication complexity to show that the O*(2k) algorithm is essentially optimal within this evaluation oracle framework. On the positive side, we give new applications of the method: finding a copy of a given tree on k nodes, a spanning tree with at least k leaves, a minimum set of nodes that dominate at least t nodes, and an m-dimensional k-matching. In each case we achieve a faster algorithm than what was known. We also apply the algebraic method to problems in exact counting. Among other results, we show that a combination of dynamic programming and a variation of the algebraic method can break the trivial upper bounds for exact parameterized counting in fairly general settings.",
